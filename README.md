### Installing via Smithery

To install railway-mcp automatically, we recommend using [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@jason-tan-swe/railway-mcp)

**Claude Desktop**

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @jason-tan-swe/railway-mcp --client claude
```

**Cursor**
```
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest run @jason-tan-swe/railway-mcp --config "{\"railwayApiToken\":\"token\"}"
```


<details>
<summary> <h3>Manual Installation For Cursor</h3></summary>

1. Head to your cursor settings and find the MCP section

2. Click 'Add new MCP server'

3. Name it however, you like, we recommend `railway-mcp` for better clarity

4. Paste this command into the 'Command' section, where <RAILWAY_API_TOKEN> is your accounts Railway token:

```bash
npx -y railway-mcp <RAILWAY_API_TOKEN>
```
</details>

<details>

<summary><h3>Manual Installation For Claude</h3></summary>

1. Create or edit your Claude for Desktop config file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the railway-mcp server to your configuration with your API token:

```json
   "railway": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "railway-mcp"],
      "env": {
         "RAILWAY_API_TOKEN": "your-railway-api-token-here"
      }
   }
```

When you have multiple MCP servers, your config file might look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    // ... All of your existing MCP servers ...

    // Add the railway-mcp server to your configuration with your API token
    "railway": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "railway-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "RAILWAY_API_TOKEN": "your-railway-api-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Restart Claude for Desktop

4. You can now start using Railway tools directly in Claude. For example:

```
Please list all my Railway projects
```

5. Alternatively, if you don't want to add your token to the configuration file, you can configure it within Claude using:

```
Please configure the Railway API with my token: {YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE}
```
</details>

## Recommendations and Other Information
This server best combines with MCP-clients that have access to terminal or with Git **(Cursor, Windsurf)**. Using this MCP with others is recommended as railway-mcp orchestrates containers and streamlines your deployment process seamlessly.

### Recommended MCP servers to combine with
- Git || [Official Link](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/git)
- GitHub || [Official](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github) || [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@smithery-ai/github)


### For Claude
- Out of the box, Claude does not have terminal access, so it cannot trigger deployments as it will not be able to get the latest commit.
- Spinning up different services and monitoring them are the best use case with Claude.


### For Cursor
- Use with GitHub MCP or have the repository already setup on GitHub and cloned locally on your machine to leverage full integration with railway-mcp.
- When Cursor makes a change, it may forget to push it's changes to GitHub causing it to try and deploy a commit that Railway cannot pull.
  - **SOLUTION:** Always ask or include somewhere in your prompt: `Have you pushed our changes to GitHub yet?`

## Security Considerations

- Railway API tokens provide full access to your account. Keep them secure.
- When using the environment variable method, your token is stored in the Claude Desktop configuration file.
- Sensitive variable values are automatically masked when displayed.
- All API calls use HTTPS for secure communication.
- The server's memory-only token storage means your token is never written to disk outside of the configuration file.

## Tool Filtering

The Railway MCP server provides **intelligent tool filtering** to manage the complexity of 146+ available tools. This feature allows you to expose only relevant subsets of tools based on your use case and complexity level.

### Why Tool Filtering?

- **Reduces Cognitive Load**: Focus on essential tools for your current task
- **Improves LLM Performance**: Smaller tool sets lead to better tool selection
- **Context Efficiency**: Saves valuable context tokens
- **Role-Based Access**: Different tool sets for different user types

### Configuration

**By default, ALL tools are enabled** (no filtering). Tool filtering only activates when you explicitly set the `RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER` environment variable.

#### Getting All Tools (Default Behavior)
```bash
# Method 1: No environment variable (default - all 146+ tools)
npx railway-mcp

# Method 2: Set to "pro" category (all 146+ tools)
export RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER="pro"

# Method 3: Set to empty string (all 146+ tools)
export RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER=""
```

#### Filtering Tools
Set the `RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER` environment variable to filter tools:

```bash
# Basic users - essential operations only (42 tools)
export RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER="simple"

# Developers - includes creation/management (65 tools) 
export RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER="intermediate"

# Multiple categories
export RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER="simple,deployment"

# Specific tools only
export RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER="project_list,service_create_from_repo,deployment_info"

# Mixed approach
export RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER="simple,backup-restore,security-audit-logs"
```

### Available Categories

#### Complexity Levels
- **`simple`** (42 tools): Information, listing, and status operations
- **`intermediate`** (65 tools): Includes simple + creation, deletion, basic management  
- **`pro`** (146+ tools): All tools including advanced workflows and enterprise features

#### Use Case Categories
- **`core`** (25 tools): Essential project, service, and deployment management
- **`deployment`** (18 tools): Service creation and deployment operations
- **`data`** (20 tools): Database, volume, backup, and variable management
- **`monitoring`** (22 tools): Logs, metrics, alerts, and observability
- **`enterprise`** (35 tools): Advanced networking, security, and compliance
- **`team`** (12 tools): Team management, usage, and billing
- **`integration`** (15 tools): Webhooks, templates, and external integrations
- **`utility`** (8 tools): Configuration and helper tools

### Filter Management Tools

The server includes built-in tools to help manage filtering:

- **`tool_filter_current`**: Show active filter configuration
- **`tool_filter_validate`**: Test filter strings before applying
- **`tool_filter_examples`**: Get example configurations for different use cases  
- **`tool_filter_categories`**: List all available categories with descriptions

### Configuration Examples

**Claude Desktop Configuration:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "railway": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "railway-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "RAILWAY_API_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
        // No RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER = all tools (default)
        // "RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER": "intermediate,monitoring"  // Optional filtering
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Command Line Usage:**
```bash
# Default: All tools (no filtering)
npx railway-mcp

# Test different filter configurations
RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER="simple" npx railway-mcp
RAILWAY_TOOLS_FILTER="deployment,data" npx railway-mcp
```

### Best Practices

- **Default is All Tools**: No configuration needed for full functionality
- **Start Simple When Filtering**: Begin with `simple` category and add more as needed
- **Use Case Focused**: Combine complexity with use case (e.g., `intermediate,deployment`)
- **Validate First**: Use `tool_filter_validate` to test configurations
- **Check Current Status**: Use `tool_filter_current` to verify active settings

## Testing Framework

This MCP server includes a comprehensive testing framework that validates all functionality against real Railway infrastructure.

### Quick Test
```bash
# Validate the complete framework
cd test-scripts
./quick-test.sh
```

### Complete Testing
```bash
# Set your Railway API token
export RAILWAY_API_TOKEN="your-railway-api-token"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Token Authentication Issues**
   - Ensure your API token is valid and has the necessary permissions
   - If using the environment variable method, check that the token is correctly formatted in the config file
   - Try using the `configure` tool directly in Claude if the environment token isn't working

2. **Server Connection Issues**
   - Check that you've installed the latest version of the server
   - Verify that Node.js version 18 or higher is installed
   - Restart Claude for Desktop after making changes to the configuration

3. **API Errors**
   - Verify that you're using correct project, environment, and service IDs
   - Check Railway's status page for any service disruptions
   - Railway API has rate limits - avoid making too many requests in a short period

After installing via Smithery or manual configuration, you can use natural language to manage Railway infrastructure:

```
# Project Management
"List all my Railway projects"
"Create a new project called 'my-startup-app'"
"Show me details for project abc123"

# Full-Stack Deployment
"Deploy a Next.js app from my GitHub repo 'username/my-app'"
"Add a PostgreSQL database to this project"
"Set the DATABASE_URL environment variable for my service"
"Create a custom domain for my app"

# Monitoring & Maintenance
"Show me the logs for my service deployment"
"Create a backup of my database"
"Set up daily automated backups"
"Generate a security audit report"
```

Claude Desktop excels at orchestrating complex workflows and providing detailed explanations of Railway operations.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>‚ö° Claude Code (CLI) Usage</strong></summary>

Claude Code provides powerful terminal integration for development workflows:

```bash
# In your terminal with Claude Code
claude "List my Railway projects and deploy the latest version of my app"

# Development workflow
claude "Create a staging environment, deploy my current branch, and run tests"

# Infrastructure management
claude "Scale up my database, check performance metrics, and optimize if needed"

# Emergency response
claude "My app is down - check logs, identify issues, and redeploy if necessary"
```

Claude Code is ideal for development workflows, CI/CD automation, and rapid infrastructure management during development.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üéØ Cursor IDE Integration</strong></summary>

Cursor provides seamless code-to-deployment workflows:

// While coding in Cursor, use natural language:

"Push my changes to GitHub and deploy to Railway staging environment"

"This API needs a Redis cache - add Redis to Railway and update my environment variables"

"Create a production environment with the same services as staging"

"Set up monitoring alerts for this new API endpoint"

// Cursor + Railway MCP workflow:
// 1. Code changes in Cursor
// 2. Cursor commits and pushes to GitHub  
// 3. Railway MCP deploys automatically
// 4. Monitor and manage through natural language
```

Cursor excels at connecting your development environment directly to Railway infrastructure with Git integration.
