## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### MCP Client Framework (`test-client/`)
```typescript
// Proper MCP SDK integration
import { Client } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js';
import { StdioClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js';

// Real Railway infrastructure testing
- Project lifecycle management
- PostgreSQL database deployment  
- GitHub service deployment
- Domain and networking setup
- Monitoring and logging
- Complete resource cleanup
```

### Test Architecture
- **4 Comprehensive Test Phases** covering all critical workflows
- **28 Individual Tests** with detailed validation
- **Performance Monitoring** with timing and success metrics
- **Real Infrastructure** - no mocks, actual Railway resources
- **Automatic Cleanup** - prevents resource accumulation

## 🔧 Available Test Commands

```bash
# Complete test suite
npm run test

# Individual test phases  
npm run test:basic      # MCP connectivity
